                <p>A food is something that provides nutrients. Nutrients are substances that provide: energy for
                    activity, growth, and all functions of the body such as breathing, digesting food, and keeping warm;
                    materials for the growth and repair of the body, and for keeping the immune system health.</p>

                <p>Shelter is a basic human need crucial for survival in cases of natural hazards
                    or conflict. It provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather,
                    and prevents ill health and disease. Adequate housing provides people with dignity
                    and the opportunity to lead a normal life</p>

                    Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty; supporting child survival,
                    growth, development and well-being; and closing the gap in social inequality.
                    On average, one additional year of education can increase an individual's earnings by 10 per cent.

            <P>The value of life is not in its duration, but in its donation. You are not important because of how long
                you live, you are important because of how effective you live. – Myles Munroe Do you want to contribute
                to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 response, help refugees and migrants, support food delivery
                to countries in crisis, or help to protect the world's cultural heritage? You can do that by donating to
                the United Nations or its agencies that are dedicated to these causes. Find out how and where you can

            <h2>They need us to survive</h2>
            <p>Another important reasons why the rich should help the poor is it helps eradicate poverty to an absolute
                end. This will help people become economically sound, socially responsible and medically fit. The
                perfect combination of all three will lead to a clean environment and help control overpopulation.In
                conclusion, leaders of the countries play an indispensable role in assisting developing nations in
                dealing with essential areas such as health, education and trade. Their aid is the key to breaking the
                vicious cycle poorer countries are locked in, which results in poverty and death.</p><br><br>
